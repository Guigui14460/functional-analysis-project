## Setup

The project being realized in Python, Python must be installed on the machine (version 3).

To install the packages (if they are not already installed), you can install them in two ways:
- via `pipenv` (creates an isolated virtual environment):
``sh
$ pipenv install
$ pipenv shell
```
  To leave the runtime environment, you must use the `deactivate` command to deactivate the isolated Python environment.
- or via the `requirements.txt` file (within a virtual environment or not) :
``sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
(under Windows, replace `pip3` with `pip`)

## Commands

**Warning :** If you are on Windows, replace `python3` with `python` in the commands below.

Three files can be executed (corresponding to the first three exercises of the project):
- `exercise1.py` : `python3 exercise1.py`
- `exercise2.py`: `python3 exercise2.py`.
- `exercise3.py` : `python3 exercise3.py`
No arguments have to be passed. All the parameters related to the exercises are already filled in the `main` of each of the above mentioned files.
